My top five resources that have had the most influence on the way I coach programming

1. https://teachtogether.tech/
2. [Mindstorms](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mindstorms-Children-Computers-Powerful-Ideas/dp/0786723882/ref=sr_1_2) by Seymour Papert
3. [An Ethic of Excellence](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ethic-Excellence-Building-Craftsmanship-Students/dp/0325005966/ref=sr_1_1) by Ron Berger
4. [Self Directed Learning](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Self-Directed-Learning-Guide-Learners-Teachers/dp/0842822151) by Malcolm Knowles (Small caveat: it's an old text and uses gendered language)
5. This [blog post](https://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/responding-to-a-students-request-for-help) by Mary Rose Cook on responding to a student request for help
