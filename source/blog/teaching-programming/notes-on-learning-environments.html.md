Notes on learning environments

There is a lot that goes into this.

When I work with coaches, sometimes I think of the team as a software infrastructure team whose job it is to create and maintain internal platforms and tools to allow other teams to do their work better, more easily, and faster.

If I apply that metaphor to an educational institution, it means that the team responsible for the learning environment is a team whose job it is to help learners learn better, more easily, and faster.

Part of the success at Makers comes from the rapid design cycle - we have groups of learners start every four weeks, allowing very quick feedback loops on what works and what doesn't - although the effect on TTJ(time to job) takes six months. We can innovate, run experments, learn from failure, and incorporate success into the fabric of the curriculum.


Based on my observations and reading, mixed in with some suggestions. These aren't meant to be distinct, discrete points, but different interpretations of the same solution space. They overlap.


1. focus on 3 parts of the learning cycle,
  - and embed this into the fabric of the environment
2. Create & maintain emphasis on taking care of yourself - positive mental and phsyical wellbeing
  The magic -> read the reviews
3. empower the learners to drive their own learning.
  - leave them be
  - respond to learner needs
4. positive, and rewarding interactions
    -  individual, and cohort, actioned (aggregate) feedback.
5. Surround with images and stories of success
6. Top end equipment
