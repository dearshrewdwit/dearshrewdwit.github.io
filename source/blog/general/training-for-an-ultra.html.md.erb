I have a goal in 2020 to run a 50k in March, and one of the UTMB races in the summer, and then to apply for [the marathon des sables](https://marathondessables.co.uk/) in 2021.

Madness.

Here's my training plan

I'm recording each run

I aim to journal throughout my training - as much for myself as for anyone else.
